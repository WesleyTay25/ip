 * {@link #getResponse()} hands back everything said since it was last called
 * and empties the buffer, so the same {@code Ui} serves both front ends: the
 * text interface prints that string, while the graphical one puts it in a
 * dialog bubble. Printing directly would have tied every {@code show} method
