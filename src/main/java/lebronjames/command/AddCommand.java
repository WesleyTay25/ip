 * adding it is the same work in all three cases. Splitting this into
 * AddTodoCommand, AddDeadlineCommand, and AddEventCommand would give three
 * classes with identical bodies.
 *
 * <p>This is also where a task the user already has is turned away. The check
 * lives here rather than in {@link TaskList} because refusing to add is a
 * decision about this command: the task list still answers whether a duplicate
 * exists, but adding is the only situation in which that answer is a problem.
