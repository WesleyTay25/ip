/**
 * Runs the Lebron James chatbot application.
 *
 * <p>An instance holds the three collaborators the chatbot needs: a {@link Ui}
 * to word its replies, a {@link Storage} to remember tasks between runs, and a
 * {@link TaskList} holding the tasks themselves.
 *
 * <p>This class no longer knows what any individual command does. It takes a
 * line, asks {@link Parser} what it means, and tells the resulting
 * {@link Command} to execute itself, which keeps the logic short enough to read
 * at a glance.
 *
 * <p>Two front ends sit on top of this class. {@link #getResponse(String)}
 * answers one command and hands back the reply as text, which is what the
 * graphical interface in {@link lebronjames.gui} puts into a dialog bubble;
 * {@link #run()} loops over that same method reading from and printing to the
 * console. Keeping the chatbot itself free of any display code is what lets
 * both exist without duplicating the command handling.
